# Hurst Exponent Based Trading Strategy

The Project covers a short term trading strategy using Hurst exponent to segment the data and then built trading models over that


The strategy was explored for four different assets:
  1. S&P 500 Index: Representative of a mature market
  2. SSE Composite: Representative of a developing market
  3. Gold: Mature commodity market
  4. Bitcoin (USD): emerging markets for cryptocurrencies


Under the "Dev" folder there are four different folders for each of above assets. Within the folder, there are four sub-folders as described:
  1. Codes: Containes Jupyter files (Python) whose name explains the code inside. The codes cover the whole spectrum; downloading data, hurst exponent calculation, segmentation, feature engineering, Grid search (GBM, RF, and XgBoost) and generate trading strategy results
  2. Data: Stores the data output of the codes. Name of csv files are self-explanatory
  3. Images: Stores the png images generated by codes (for reference, and documentation). Same images can also be found in the Jupyter notebooks
  4. Models: Store the "pickled" version of the selected models based on Grid Search
